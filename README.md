[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/henne90gen/ChestCounter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/henne90gen/ChestCounter)

This is a Minecraft mod that allows you to count all the items that you have in your chests.
Items are counted by simply opening chests.
Later on you can query for specific items or search for a certain key word.
The mod will list all items that you have in various chests.

## TODOs

- resource packs screw up the labels above the chests in the world
- make it work in creative mode
